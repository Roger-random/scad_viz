# Motion visualization experiments using OpenSCAD

This is an OpenSCAD learning project with a focus on using OpenSCAD animation to do a 
rough draft visualisation of how various physical pieces might interact with each
other.

Most of the designs will be relatively uninteresting to look at, with plain shapes
(mostly boxes) sitting next to each other, until OpenSCAD animation is started to see
how they move.
